# premier_league_simulator
I made this homework project for my Java class in university. It simulates a Premier League season, ranking all 20 participating teams based on player ratings imported from Fifa. I predicted the result for each match using a probabilistic approach.
The project also has a GUI where I used Java's graphic extensions like Swing and AWT, and I built the project in ItelliJ, and there is a source file (test.java) that includes JUnit tests to my application.
The source files have Javadoc comments in Hungarian.
